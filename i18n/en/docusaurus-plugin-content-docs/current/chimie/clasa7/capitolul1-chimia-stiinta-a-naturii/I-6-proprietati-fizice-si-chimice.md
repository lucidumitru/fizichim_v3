The characteristic attributes with a help of which a substance is recognized are called **properties**.


**Properties** can be physical and chemical.

<br></br>
<br></br>



## I.6.1. Physical properties.



<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**Physical properties** are those attributes that refer to appearance or transformations that do not change the composition of the substance.


</div>


<br></br>


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**Physical properties** can be classified into:


***1. Observable*** with the help of the sense organs:

**- By sight**: state of aggregation (solid, liquid, gas), color (colorless-without colour or colored), gloss (shine).

**- By smell**: odorless (has no smell), pleasant, irritating, specific smell (milk, chlorine, vinegar - we say they have a specific smell).

**- By touch**: plasticity, elasticity, soft (hardness), hard (hardness).



<br></br>



***2. Measurable*** with the help of devices:

**- Physical constants**:
- **Melting temperature** (the temperature at which a solid substance begins to melt = T<sub>t</sub>);
- **Boiling temperature** (the temperature at which a liquid begins to boil = T<sub>v</sub>);
- **Density**           <Img className="img-responsive4" src="chimie/clasa7/capitolul1/I-6-1-physical-properties-picture1-density-formula_vers2.png" width="1000" height="98" lazy={false} />
- **Refractive index**    <Img className="img-responsive4" src="chimie/clasa7/capitolul1/I-6-1-physical-properties-picture2-refractive-index-formula_vers2.png" width="1000" height="114" lazy={false} />
- **Solubility coefficient** (shows how much substance dissolves in 100 g of water, at a certain temperature);
- **Hardness** (it is measured according to a scale of hardness from 1 to 10, called "Mohs Scale", where talc has 1 and diamond the highest hardness 10);
- **Electrical and thermal conductivity** (passage of electric current, respectively heat, without movement of substance).

## I.6.2. Chemical properties.


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">



**Chemical properties** are those properties that refer to transformations that change the composition of the substance.

**Examples of chemical properties:**


**- The property of burning (after burning the paper, we no longer have paper, we have ashes);**

**- The property of fats to go rancid (the rancidity is a different substance than the non-rancid oil);**

**- The property of wine to turn into vinegar (vinegar is a different substance than wine);**

**- The property of milk to turn sour (sour milk has a different composition and other properties than sweet milk);**

**- The property of iron to rust (rust is a substance other than iron);**

**- Copper's property of coking (coking is a different substance from copper;**

**- The property of wood to rot (rot has a different composition than wood).**

***Electrical conductivity of some substances***



&#128064 **Experiment: Electrical conductors and insulators**

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6DwEd43Fhk" />


**Required Materials:**    
Circuit consisting of a battery, connecting wires, light bulb, metal wires, graphite lead, wood, glass, rubber gum.



**Experiment description:**
- Connect the bulb to the battery and at the ends of the two free ends of the circuit intercalate different substances (iron, copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead, aluminum, graphite, glass, wood, rubber) and observe on which substances the bulb lights up.




<br></br>

**Experiment conclusion:**       
Some substances have the property of being electrical conductors, allowing electric current to pass through them (all metals, graphite). This property is called electrical conductivity – a physical property because it does not change the composition of the substance. Other substances are electrical insulators - that is, they do not allow current to pass through them (glass, wood, rubber, etc.).

**Experiment description:**
- Light a candle and drip the melted wax along the wire, let the wax beads harden.
- Hold the waxed wire with the tongs in the flame of the spirit flask and observe how the wax beads melt.




<br></br>

**Experiment conclusion:**      
Metals have the property of conducting heat through them from the heated end to the unheated end, called thermal conductivity, that is, they are thermal conductors – physical property because they do not change the composition of the substance.






</div>



<br></br>

<div class="alert alert--success" role="alert">

&#128064 **Experiment: Water is a thermal insulator**       
&#128293 **Warning!** This experiment is performed only in the presence of an adult!      
&#128293 **Warning!** When working with fire sources make sure to keep your hair tight and don't wear clothes with wide sleeves!


<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJXKmFISUpY" />


**Required Materials:**     
Candle, spirit flask, metal tongs, test tube, water, match.


**Experiment description:**
- Put water in a test tube, up to the middle of the test tube;
- At the flame of a spirit flask, heat the water in the test tube at the top, holding the test tube with your hand at the bottom and pointing the mouth at the opposite side of you.



<br></br>


**Experiment conclusion:**

- After a while, the water on the surface begins to boil, while at the bottom you don't feel the heat at all.
- Water is a bad conductor of heat. All liquids (except mercury, which is a metal) are thermal insulators. The uniform heating of liquids and gases takes place by convection, with the help of currents (displacement of substance).

&#128064 **Experiment: Air is a thermal insulator**    
&#128293 **Warning!** This experiment is performed only in the presence of an adult!      
&#128293 **Warning!** When working with fire sources make sure to keep your hair tight and don't wear clothes with wide sleeves!


<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVmB-YIRIVo" />


**Required Materials:**    
Candle, spirit flask, metal tongs, test tube, match.


**Experiment description:**
- Take the empty test tube (ie with air) and insert a finger at the open end of the test tube;
- Heat the bottom of the test tube (the closed part) in the flame of the spirit flask, shaking it continuously so that it does not break.

<br></br>

**Experiment conclusion:**
- The finger in the test tube does not feel the heat at all.
- Air is a poor conductor of heat. In general, all gases are thermal insulators, but especially rarefied gases. The fibers of woolen clothes, animal fur, bird feathers, snow are thermal insulators, because they contain air.

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cL01iloQrHQ" />



**Required Materials:**     
Erlenmeyer beaker with distilled water, rubber stopper fitted with thermometer, asbestos sieve, spirit flask, matches, clock or stopwatch.



**Experiment description:**
- Close the water in the glass with the stopper fitted with the thermometer so that the thermometer does not enter the water and heat the water through the strainer at the still flame.
- Measure the time since the start of the heating and complete the following table:

<Img className="img-responsive4" src="chimie/clasa7/capitolul1/I-6-3-observation-of-the-physical-and-chemical-properties-of-some-substances-picture-1-experiment-water-boils-at-100-degrees-celsius_vers2.png" width="1000" height="80" />



<br></br>






**Experiment conclusion:**
- Water has the property of boiling at 100 °C – physical property, because it does not change the composition of the substance (steam is still water, but in a gaseous state)
- Every liquid begins to boil at a certain temperature, called the boiling point, which is a constant of the material (see table of constants at the end of the manual). During boiling, the boiling temperature is constant.
