**Matter. Body. Substance.**


**Matter** is everything that surrounds us.

**Matter has two forms of existence:**

***- Substance or material.***

***- Field:***
- **gravitational** (around a particle that has mass or around the Earth);
- **electrostatic** (around an electrified body);
- **electric** (around an electric circuit);
- **magnetic** (around a magnet or an electric circuit);
- **electromagnetic** (the mutual generation of electric and magnetic fields).


<br></br>


The **body** represents the portion of matter with its own shape and its own volume (well determined).


Examples of bodies: human body, table, chair, house, glass of milk, etc.

**Bodies are made up of matter with:**
- Homogeneous composition throughout its own mass which are called **substances** (examples: metals, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, diamond, kitchen salt, bruised stone, nitrogen, etc.).
- Heterogeneous (which is not the same) composition which are called **materials**. For example: wood (contains cellulose, lignin, water), paper (cellulose), cement, concrete, porcelain, granite, plastics, glass, etc.).





**The nail: the nail is a body because it has its own shape and its own volume.**

<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>



**Iron: iron is a substance because it has no shape of its own and can take many forms: a nail, a doorknob, a table, a chair, a cabinet, etc.**

**Physical and chemical phenomena.**



**Physical phenomena** are the transformations of a body as a result of which the composition of the substance of which the body is made remains unchanged.



**Examples of physical phenomena:**

- All the phenomena that occur with the change of state of aggregation:
  - **Melting** (the transition of the substance from a solid state to a liquid state, by heating);
  - **Solidification** (the transition of the substance from a liquid state to a solid state, by cooling);
  - **Vaporization** (the transition of the substance from a liquid state to a gaseous state, by heating);
  - **Condensation** (the passage of the substance from a gaseous state to a liquid state, by cooling);
  - **Sublimation** (the transition of the substance from a solid state to a gaseous state, by heating);
  - **Desublimation** (the passage of the substance from a gaseous state to a solid state, by cooling).


- Deformation (change of shape);

- Movement (change of position relative to the landmark);

- Heating / Cooling (temperature change);

- Expansion / Contraction (change in temperature and volume);

- Coloring (color change);

- Crushing (changing the size of the crystals);

- The passage of electric current through a circuit;

- Interaction of magnets or electrified bodies (attraction or repulsion);

- Reflection and Refraction of light (the return of light in the first medium, respectively the passage of light in the second medium, with a change in the direction of propagation);

- Rainbow formation (decomposition of white light into rainbow colors), etc.




<br></br>
<br></br>



**Chemical phenomena** are transformations that change the composition of substances, resulting in other substances.



**Examples of chemical phenomena:**

- Combustion of fuels (transformation of the substance in the presence of oxygen into carbon dioxide and water);

- Rusting of iron (iron turns into rust, reddish);

- Coking of copper (copper turns into coking, greenish, toxic);

- Fermentation of must (wine is obtained);

- Acidification of the wine (vinegar is obtained);

- Milk fermentation (beaten milk is obtained);

- Rotting of plants (it is caused by a fungus that destroys the plant);

- Photosynthesis (plants in the presence of light transform carbon dioxide into oxygen);

- Carbonization of sugar;

- Slow oxidations in the body (breathing of beings, oxidation of fats, proteins and carbohydrates from food).

**Physical and chemical properties**


The characteristic attributes with a help of which a substance is recognized are called **properties**.


**Properties** can be physical and chemical.



**Physical properties** are those attributes that refer to appearance or transformations that do not change the composition of the substance.

**Physical properties** can be classified into:


***1. Observable*** with the help of the sense organs:

**- By sight**: state of aggregation (solid, liquid, gas), color (colorless-without colour or colored), gloss (shine).

**- By smell**: odorless (has no smell), pleasant, irritating, specific smell (milk, chlorine, vinegar - we say they have a specific smell).

**- By touch**: plasticity, elasticity, soft (hardness), hard (hardness).



<br></br>



***2. Measurable*** with the help of devices:

**- Physical constants**:
- **Melting temperature** (the temperature at which a solid substance begins to melt = T<sub>t</sub>);
- **Boiling temperature** (the temperature at which a liquid begins to boil = T<sub>v</sub>);
- **Density**           <Img className="img-responsive4" src="chimie/clasa7/capitolul1/I-6-1-physical-properties-picture1-density-formula_vers2.png" width="1000" height="98" lazy={false} />
- **Refractive index**    <Img className="img-responsive4" src="chimie/clasa7/capitolul1/I-6-1-physical-properties-picture2-refractive-index-formula_vers2.png" width="1000" height="114" lazy={false} />
- **Solubility coefficient** (shows how much substance dissolves in 100 g of water, at a certain temperature);
- **Hardness** (it is measured according to a scale of hardness from 1 to 10, called "Mohs Scale", where talc has 1 and diamond the highest hardness 10);
- **Electrical and thermal conductivity** (passage of electric current, respectively heat, without movement of substance).



<br></br>
<br></br>



**Chemical properties** are those properties that refer to transformations that change the composition of the substance.

**Examples of chemical properties:**


**- The property of burning (after burning the paper, we no longer have paper, we have ashes);**

**- The property of fats to go rancid (the rancidity is a different substance than the non-rancid oil);**

**- The property of wine to turn into vinegar (vinegar is a different substance than wine);**

**- The property of milk to turn sour (sour milk has a different composition and other properties than sweet milk);**

**- The property of iron to rust (rust is a substance other than iron);**

**- Copper's property of coking (coking is a different substance from copper;**

**- The property of wood to rot (rot has a different composition than wood).**
