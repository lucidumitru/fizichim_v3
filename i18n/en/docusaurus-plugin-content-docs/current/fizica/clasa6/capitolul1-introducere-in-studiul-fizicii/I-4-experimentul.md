The experiment serves simultaneously both as a source of knowledge and as a method of learning. To experiment means to intentionally provoke certain phenomena, under certain conditions, for their study and the laws that govern them.

_Observation and measurement_ are fundamental activities in physics. Starting from the observation of some natural phenomena, _laboratory experiments are performed_, in which measurements are made in order to find the _physical laws and mathematical formulas_ that govern the studied phenomenon.
