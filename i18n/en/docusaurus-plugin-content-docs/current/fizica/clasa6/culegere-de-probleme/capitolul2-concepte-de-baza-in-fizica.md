&#128275 **Experimental Problem - Direct measurement of length.**


**2.1. Determining the actual length of a body.**



<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKSM056fiTU" lazy={false} />




**Required materials:**   
Graduated ruler, pencil.

<br></br>

**Experiment description:**
- Use the graduated ruler to measure the length of the physics book.
- Measure the length of the physics book several times (at least 3 times), taking care to measure correctly each time.
- Fill in the following table of experimental data: you will pass your determinations and follow the steps according to the following model:



<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/II-2-1-2-measurement-error-picture1-data-table-for-measuring-the-real-length-of-a-body-experiment.png" width="1000" height="268" />



- Processes experimental data.
  - l is the length measured at least three times. I measured it four times, but the last value of 20 cm I excluded it, as it is far from the other values, being a rough measurement.
  - l<sub>m</sub> is the average length, ie the arithmetic average of the three measured lengths. If some values appear very different from the others, they are written in the table, but they are cut, they represent gross errors. They are not taken into account in the calculation of the average length. The arithmetic average is equal to the ratio of the sum of all lengths to the number of determinations.
  - Δl is the absolute error, which is calculated by the difference between the measured length and the average length (the largest minus the smallest): Δl = l<sub>1</sub> – l<sub>m</sub> sau Δl = l<sub>m</sub> – l<sub>1</sub>.
  - Δl<sub>m</sub> is the absolute average error, which is calculated by making the arithmetic average of the absolute errors.
- After completing the table with experimental data, you must write the result of the determination, using the same number of decimals for all numbers. We will write the values with two decimal places, by rounding.




For our example: L = 25,9 cm ± 0,06 cm.

<br></br>

**Experiment conclusion:**   
This result indicates that the actual value is in a range: 25,9 cm – 0,06 cm ≤ l ≤ 25,9 cm + 0,06 cm    
So the real length of the physics book is: 25,84 cm ≤ l ≤ 25,96 cm.

&#128275 **Solved problem - Direct measurement of length.**


**2.2. Florin wants to determine the real value of the length of the kitchen table.**

Following the measurements he found the following values: 1,5 m; 1,46 m; 1,6 m ; 1,2 m; 1,56 m.  How did he proceed?


**Solution:**

_He calculated l<sub>m</sub> = The average length, ie the arithmetic average of the four measured lengths. The value of 1.2 m is very different, it is cut and not taken into account in the calculation of the average length, being a rough measurement._



<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/II-2-1-2-measurement-error-picture2-solution-part1-determining-the-real-length-of-the-kitchen-table-solved-problem.png" width="1000" height="84" />

<br></br>
<br></br>




_He calculated for each measurement Δl = absolute error, which is calculated by the difference between the measured length and the average length (the largest minus the smallest); Δl = l<sub>1</sub> – l<sub>m</sub> sau Δl = l<sub>m</sub> – l<sub>1</sub>._

Δl<sub>1</sub> = 1,53 - 1,5 = 0,03 m    
Δl<sub>2</sub> = 1,53 - 1,46 = 0,07 m    
Δl<sub>3</sub> = 1,6 - 1,53 = 0,07 m    
Δl<sub>4</sub> = 1,56 - 1,53 = 0,03 m

<br></br>

_He calculated Δl<sub>m</sub> = the absolute average error, which is calculated by making the arithmetic average of the four absolute errors._



<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/II-2-1-2-measurement-error-picture3-solution-part2-determining-the-real-length-of-the-kitchen-table-solved-problem.png" width="1000" height="77" />


<br></br>
<br></br>


_Florin wrote the result of the determination, using the same number of decimals for all numbers (values with two decimals, by rounding)._   
**Result of the determination = The average value ± The absolute average error**   
**l = l<sub>average</sub> ± Δl<sub>average</sub>  = 1,53 m ± 0,05 m.**

&#128275 **Experimental Problem - Direct area measurement.**




**2.3. Direct measurement of the area of a leaf with graph paper..**



<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3smXeDNmZc" />



**Required materials:**    
Graph paper, leaf, pencil.


<br></br>

**Experiment description:**
- Draw on the graph paper (you can also use a math sheet that has a side of 0,5 cm and an area of 0,25 cm<sup>2</sup>, but the result will not be too precise) the contour of the leaf (you can choose any shape you want, not necessarily a leaf).
- Count the whole squares with an area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> (those outlined with a blue marker), then those with an area of 0.25 cm<sup>2</sup> (those outlined in yellow), and group the whole ones and approximate them as whole squares with area of 0.25 cm<sup>2</sup>. If you have patience, you can stop approximating the whole squares and count the small squares with the area of 1 mm<sup>2</sup> and their number multiplied by 1 mm<sup>2</sup> to turn it into cm<sup>2</sup>, by dividing the result by 100.
- To calculate the area of the leaf (S), apply the formula: S = n ∙ Su, where n = no. squares and Su = area of the chosen unit (either cm<sup>2</sup> - the largest, or 0.25 cm<sup>2</sup> - the smallest).
- Draw the outline of the leaf on another graph paper and repeat the above operations so that you have at least three values of the area of the leaf of your choice.

<br></br>
<br></br>


- Fill in the experimental data table and process the data in the table.

<br></br>
<br></br>



<br></br>



**Experiment conclusion:**   
So the real area of the leaf is: **S = S<sub>average</sub> ± ΔS<sub>average</sub> = 14,58 cm<sup>2</sup> ±  0,11cm<sup>2</sup>**.

&#128275 **Experimental problem - Direct measurement of the volume.**


**2.8. Measuring the volume of a body with the graduated cylinder.**



<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enNZdK5iQeM" />


**Required materials:**    
Graduated cylinder, water, string, a body.

<br></br>

**Experiment description:**


**2.8.A.** The first step is to determine the volume of a division = 1 div = the minimum volume between two consecutive lines. Look carefully at the measurement and find the measurement unit of the cylinder used. How do we proceed?


- Note two consecutive graduations (one after the other) of the cylinder and subtract them: 50 ml - 40 ml = 10 ml
- Count how many divisions there are between these notations: 10 divisions = 10 ml
- With the simple rule of three, we find out the volume of one division:


<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/II-2-4-direct-measurement-of-volume-picture3-experiment-measuring-the-volume-of-a-body-with-the-graduated-cylinder-calculation-rule-of-3-simple.png" width="1000" height="202" />


<br></br>
<br></br>


**2.8.B.** Put water in the cylinder and measure its volume, denoted by **V<sub>1</sub> = 35 ml.**

<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/II-2-4-direct-measurement-of-volume-picture4-experiment-measuring-the-volume-of-a-body-with-the-graduated-cylinder-water-volume.png" width="1000" height="373" />

<br></br>
<br></br>


**2.8.C.** Insert the body into the water in the cylinder. The fluid level has risen. We will note the new volume read **V<sub>2</sub> = 39 ml.**


<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/II-2-4-direct-measurement-of-volume-picture5-experiment-measuring-the-volume-of-a-body-with-the-graduated-cylinder-water-plus-body-volume.png" width="1000" height="373" />

<br></br>
<br></br>



**2.8.D.**. The volume of the body is the difference between V<sub>2</sub> (water+body volume) and V<sub>1</sub> (water volume), ie:




**V<sub>body</sub> = V<sub>2</sub> – V<sub>1</sub>**



<br></br>




**Remark:**
> The graduated cylinder must be on a horizontal surface (on the table). The free surface of the liquid is slightly curved (called the meniscus) - higher at the contact of the liquid with the walls of the graduated cylinder. Position the eyes at the free surface of the liquid and read the volume at its base.



<br></br>


**Experiment conclusion:**


**The volume of the body** is the difference between V<sub>2</sub> (water volume + body) and V<sub>1</sub> (water volume), ie:



**V<sub>body</sub> = V<sub>2</sub> – V<sub>1</sub>**


**V<sub>body</sub>** = 39 ml – 35 ml = 4 ml.

**2.12. Measuring the period of a pendulum with a stopwatch.**


<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DwkOa10Gt4" />


**Required materials:**     
Ball or nut, thread, stopwatch (you can use the phone)


<br></br>


**Experiment description:**


- Take a small and heavy body (a ball, a nut, a key, etc.) and tie it to the end of a wire to get a pendulum. Attach the wire to a horizontal support (for example, a table).

- Remove the wire from the (vertical) equilibrium position and lift it to one side. Then release it and the pendulum will move to either side of this position, ie it will start to oscillate. The stopwatch starts when the body is released.

- Measure the time interval (t) in which the body returns a number of times "n" to point A ("n" can have different values: 3, 5, 8, 10 etc. - as much as you want).

- Repeat the operation at least 3 times, giving it to "n" different values.

- Calculate the period (T) = the time in which the body makes a complete oscillation, ie the time in which the pendulum climbed to the other side and returned to the initial position (round trip). If in a time "t" are performed "n" full oscillations, then the period (T) is calculated using the relation:

&#128275 **Solved problem - Direct measurement of the time interval.**


**2.13. A movie broadcast on a TV station started at 20:30 and ended at 22:20. If he was interrupted by four commercials, each lasting 8 minutes, how long did the film last, expressed in hours, minutes and seconds?**


**Solution:**

_We calculate the broadcast time of both the film and the advertisement, subtracting the end time from the start time of the film: to decrease the minutes, I borrow from the unit of hours by one hour, ie 60 minutes and add them to 20 minutes and say 80 min - 30 min = 50 min._    
Then decrease 21 h - 20 h = 1h. 22:20 - 20:30 = 1 h 50 min = t<sub>1</sub>.




_We calculate the time of the advertising blocks (sequences): t<sub>2</sub> = 4 ∙ 8 min = 32 min_

_To find out the length of the movie only, subtract t<sub>2</sub> from t<sub>1</sub>:_


t<sub>movie</sub> = t<sub>1</sub> – t<sub>2</sub> = 1 h 50 min – 32 min = 1 h 18 min    
t<sub>movie</sub> = 60 min + 18 min = 78 min = 78 ∙ 60 s = 4680 s

<br></br>


_To find out the duration in hours we transform 18 min into h with the simple rule of 3:_
