## II.2.1. Direct measurement of length.


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**Characterization of length as physical parameter:**

<div class="alert alert--secondary" role="alert">


Since ancient times, man has measured different lengths using as units of measure the step, elbow, palm etc.


Today, in order to have a valid unit of international length, the **meter** is used. 



**<Img className="img-responsive3" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_210_1_MetrulEtalon_vers7.jpg" width="1000" height="360" /> The standard meter** is made of a platinum and iridium ruler, kept in special conditions, protected from moisture and temperature differences, at the **International Bureau of Measures and Weights** located in Sèvres (near Paris). Each country has a copy of the standard meter.

**Instruments used for measuring lengths:**

<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_210_2_InstrumentePentruMasurareaLungimii_vers3.jpg" width="1000" height="184" />

1 – Ruler

2 – Tape line

3 – Callipers

4 – Tailoring centimeter


</div>





<br></br>

<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**Measuring the distance with the ruler:**

When we want to measure with the ruler, we place it above the length to be measured so that the zero division is at one end of this length. To make the reading accurate, you need to make sure that the gaze falls perpendicular to the ruler, in front of the respective division.

<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_210_3_RegulaDeMasurareAUneiLungimi_vers2.jpg" width="1000" height="290" />

<br></br>


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**Indirect measurement of lengths** can be done for objects we cannot reach, for rugged, swampy or water-covered terrain.

Some methods used for indirect measurement of lengths are optical methods, related to the rectilinear propagation of light. Distance reading is done on a digital screen: rangefinder (laser beam), GPS.

### II.2.1.1. The dimensions of a body in space.


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

A body in space has three dimensions:

Length - denoted by L = AB = CD = A'B '= C'D',

Width - denoted by l = BC = AD = B'C '= A'D'

Height - vertical dimension denoted by h = AA '= BB' = CC '= DD'.


<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_210_4_DimensiunileUnuiCorp_vers3.jpg" width="1000" height="360" />


</div>



<br></br>
<br></br>


### II.2.1.2. Measurement error.

<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**Any measurement has limited accuracy** and therefore the notion of **measurement error** appears.

</div>


<br></br>

**Sources of error** can be:

- **lack of accuracy** of the measurement instrument;
- **incorrect reading** of the instrument indications;
- **the lack of attention or skill** of the person making the measurements;
- **unfavorable environmental conditions** (inadequate lighting, too hot or too cold, discomfort, etc.).

If we perform length measurements with a ruler, the measurement accuracy cannot exceed the smallest gradation of the ruler - respectively 1 mm.

So **the measurement error due to the instrument used** is equal to **the smallest division of the instrument**.


**Example:**

At the micrometer the measurement error decreases to 1 micron, ie one millionth of a meter (1 / 1000000).

The existence of measurement errors in the case of experimental determinations is normal and in order to obtain a result as close as possible **to the true value of the measured quantity**, the measurements are repeated several times and the experimental data are processed as I will show you in the next experiment.

&#128064 **Experiment no. 1: Determining the actual length of a body.**





<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKSM056fiTU" />




**Required materials:**   
Graduated ruler, pencil.

<br></br>

**Experiment description:**
- Use the graduated ruler to measure the length of the physics book.
- Measure the length of the physics book several times (at least 3 times), taking care to measure correctly each time.
- Fill in the following table of experimental data: you will pass your determinations and follow the steps according to the following model:



<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/II-2-1-2-measurement-error-picture1-data-table-for-measuring-the-real-length-of-a-body-experiment.png" width="1000" height="268" />



- Processes experimental data.
  - l is the length measured at least three times. I measured it four times, but the last value of 20 cm I excluded it, as it is far from the other values, being a rough measurement.
  - l<sub>m</sub> is the average length, ie the arithmetic average of the three measured lengths. If some values appear very different from the others, they are written in the table, but they are cut, they represent gross errors. They are not taken into account in the calculation of the average length. The arithmetic average is equal to the ratio of the sum of all lengths to the number of determinations.
  - Δl is the absolute error, which is calculated by the difference between the measured length and the average length (the largest minus the smallest): Δl = l<sub>1</sub> – l<sub>m</sub> sau Δl = l<sub>m</sub> – l<sub>1</sub>.
  - Δl<sub>m</sub> is the absolute average error, which is calculated by making the arithmetic average of the absolute errors.
- After completing the table with experimental data, you must write the result of the determination, using the same number of decimals for all numbers. We will write the values with two decimal places, by rounding.




For our example: L = 25,9 cm ± 0,06 cm.

<br></br>

**Experiment conclusion:**   
This result indicates that the actual value is in a range: 25,9 cm – 0,06 cm ≤ l ≤ 25,9 cm + 0,06 cm    
So the real length of the physics book is: 25,84 cm ≤ l ≤ 25,96 cm.

**1. Florin wants to determine the real value of the length of the kitchen table.**

Following the measurements he found the following values: 1,5 m; 1,46 m; 1,6 m ; 1,2 m; 1,56 m.  How did he proceed?


**Solution:**

_He calculated l<sub>m</sub> = The average length, ie the arithmetic average of the four measured lengths. The value of 1.2 m is very different, it is cut and not taken into account in the calculation of the average length, being a rough measurement._



<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/II-2-1-2-measurement-error-picture2-solution-part1-determining-the-real-length-of-the-kitchen-table-solved-problem.png" width="1000" height="84" />

<br></br>
<br></br>




_He calculated for each measurement Δl = absolute error, which is calculated by the difference between the measured length and the average length (the largest minus the smallest); Δl = l<sub>1</sub> – l<sub>m</sub> sau Δl = l<sub>m</sub> – l<sub>1</sub>._

Δl<sub>1</sub> = 1,53 - 1,5 = 0,03 m    
Δl<sub>2</sub> = 1,53 - 1,46 = 0,07 m    
Δl<sub>3</sub> = 1,6 - 1,53 = 0,07 m    
Δl<sub>4</sub> = 1,56 - 1,53 = 0,03 m

<br></br>

_He calculated Δl<sub>m</sub> = the absolute average error, which is calculated by making the arithmetic average of the four absolute errors._

_Florin wrote the result of the determination, using the same number of decimals for all numbers (values with two decimals, by rounding)._

<br></br>

**Experiment description:**
- Draw on the graph paper (you can also use a math sheet that has a side of 0,5 cm and an area of 0,25 cm<sup>2</sup>, but the result will not be too precise) the contour of the leaf (you can choose any shape you want, not necessarily a leaf).
- Count the whole squares with an area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> (those outlined with a blue marker), then those with an area of 0.25 cm<sup>2</sup> (those outlined in yellow), and group the whole ones and approximate them as whole squares with area of 0.25 cm<sup>2</sup>. If you have patience, you can stop approximating the whole squares and count the small squares with the area of 1 mm<sup>2</sup> and their number multiplied by 1 mm<sup>2</sup> to turn it into cm<sup>2</sup>, by dividing the result by 100.
- To calculate the area of the leaf (S), apply the formula: S = n ∙ Su, where n = no. squares and Su = area of the chosen unit (either cm<sup>2</sup> - the largest, or 0.25 cm<sup>2</sup> - the smallest).
- Draw the outline of the leaf on another graph paper and repeat the above operations so that you have at least three values of the area of the leaf of your choice.

<br></br>
<br></br>



**4.** The volume of the body is the difference between V<sub>2</sub> (water+body volume) and V<sub>1</sub> (water volume), ie:




**V<sub>body</sub> = V<sub>2</sub> – V<sub>1</sub>**



<br></br>




**Remark:**
> The graduated cylinder must be on a horizontal surface (on the table). The free surface of the liquid is slightly curved (called the meniscus) - higher at the contact of the liquid with the walls of the graduated cylinder. Position the eyes at the free surface of the liquid and read the volume at its base.



<br></br>


**Experiment conclusion:**


**The volume of the body** is the difference between V<sub>2</sub> (water volume + body) and V<sub>1</sub> (water volume), ie:



**V<sub>body</sub> = V<sub>2</sub> – V<sub>1</sub>**


**V<sub>body</sub>** = 39 ml – 35 ml = 4 ml.

**1. A room has a length of 0.06 hm, a width of 40 dm and a height of 330 cm. Calculate the volume of air in the room in m<sup>3</sup>.**


**Solution:**

_We note the data of the problem and transform the given parameters into SI:_

The Romans called the hours before noon **ante meridiem** (before noon), and those in the afternoon, **post meridiem**. Today, they are abbreviated **a.m.** and **p.m.** and are used with the meaning of morning and afternoon.

If you use the electronic stopwatch on the phone, which also measures hundredths of seconds, then its accuracy has increased to **0.01s**. On the other hand, if you use a ticker, its accuracy is lower and the error can be **1s** .

&#128064 **Experiment no. 4: Measuring the period of a pendulum with a stopwatch.**



<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DwkOa10Gt4" />




**Required materials:**     
Ball or nut, thread, stopwatch (you can use the phone)


<br></br>


**Experiment description:**


- Take a small and heavy body (a ball, a nut, a key, etc.) and tie it to the end of a wire to get a pendulum. Attach the wire to a horizontal support (for example, a table).

- Remove the wire from the (vertical) equilibrium position and lift it to one side. Then release it and the pendulum will move to either side of this position, ie it will start to oscillate. The stopwatch starts when the body is released.

- Measure the time interval (t) in which the body returns a number of times "n" to point A ("n" can have different values: 3, 5, 8, 10 etc. - as much as you want).

- Repeat the operation at least 3 times, giving it to "n" different values.

- Calculate the period (T) = the time in which the body makes a complete oscillation, ie the time in which the pendulum climbed to the other side and returned to the initial position (round trip). If in a time "t" are performed "n" full oscillations, then the period (T) is calculated using the relation:

&#128275 **Solved problem**

**1. A movie broadcast on a TV station started at 20:30 and ended at 22:20. If he was interrupted by four commercials, each lasting 8 minutes, how long did the film last, expressed in hours, minutes and seconds?**



**Solution:**

_We calculate the broadcast time of both the film and the advertisement, subtracting the end time from the start time of the film: to decrease the minutes, I borrow from the unit of hours by one hour, ie 60 minutes and add them to 20 minutes and say 80 min - 30 min = 50 min._    
Then decrease 21 h - 20 h = 1h. 22:20 - 20:30 = 1 h 50 min = t<sub>1</sub>.




_We calculate the time of the advertising blocks (sequences): t<sub>2</sub> = 4 ∙ 8 min = 32 min_

_To find out the length of the movie only, subtract t<sub>2</sub> from t<sub>1</sub>:_


t<sub>movie</sub> = t<sub>1</sub> – t<sub>2</sub> = 1 h 50 min – 32 min = 1 h 18 min    
t<sub>movie</sub> = 60 min + 18 min = 78 min = 78 ∙ 60 s = 4680 s

<br></br>


_To find out the duration in hours we transform 18 min into h with the simple rule of 3:_
