&#128272 **Recapitulative exercises - Movement and Rest.**


**1.  Determine whether the following statements are true (A) or false (F):**

a) A house is at rest relative to the sun.

b) The bus driver is at rest in front of the passengers in the seats.

c) An airplane is in a state of motion relative to the ground.

d) The average speed is the arithmetic mean of the momentary velocities of the mobile.

e) A body is in accelerated rectilinear motion.

f) A mobile has a rotational motion when its trajectory is a circle.

g) In uniform rectilinear motion the mobile travels equal distances in equal time intervals.

h) The graph of uniform rectilinear motion is a straight line.

i) When a body starts it has a slow motion.

j) When a body stops it has an accelerated movement.
