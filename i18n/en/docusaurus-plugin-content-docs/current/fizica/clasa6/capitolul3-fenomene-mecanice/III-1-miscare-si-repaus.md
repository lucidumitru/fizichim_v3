The monument Kilometer zero, was designed by architects Horia Creanga and Stefan Niculescu and materialized by the sculptor Constantin Baraschi in 1938. The monument at Kilometer 0 is a rose of the winds, between whose rays are engraved the names of the main Romanian historical provinces: Transylvania, Banat, Bassarabia , Bucovina, Dobrogea, Moldova, Muntenia and Oltenia.

**A body is in a state of motion** when the body changes its position (or distance) from the chosen landmark.

**E.g:**   

You're in the physics lab, in the bank, in physics class. What mechanical condition are you in, moving or at rest?

If you choose as a landmark: the bench, the wall, the blackboard, etc. you are at rest, because you do not change your distance from these landmarks.

If you choose as a landmark: a traveler on the street, a bird flying out the window, the Sun, the Moon, etc. you are in a state of motion, because you change your distance from these landmarks.

</div>

<br></br>


<div class="alert alert--info" role="alert">

We say that movement and rest are **relative states**, because they depend on the chosen landmark. So we can be in a certain moment of time both in motion and at rest depending on the chosen landmark.   

But we cannot say about a body that it is both moving and at rest, at a certain moment and compared to the same landmark.

</div>


<br></br>



<div class="alert alert--secondary" role="alert">

There is no absolutely fixed body (landmark) in the whole Universe, because there is no body at absolute rest. All bodies are moving relative to each other, because in reality, the chosen landmark is itself moving relative to other landmarks.

For example, I am resting in front of her in the car. But the car is moving against the road. The road moves towards the Earth with it. The earth moves toward its own axis and toward the Sun and other celestial bodies. Our solar system is moving toward our Galaxy, the Milky Way. Our galaxy is moving relative to the other galaxies in the universe.

**But when we study the movement of a mobile with respect to a reference system (denoted SR), we consider its fixed landmark.**

<br></br>



## III.1.2. Traveled distance. Movement duration.


<div class="alert alert--info" role="alert">

To calculate the distance traveled by a mobile, you need to set a reference point, called the origin.

- If the origin is right in the landmark, we denote by O (that is, x<sub>0</sub> = 0 m).
- If the origin is not exactly in the landmark, we denote by another point, A (for example, x<sub>1</sub> = 20 km from the landmark).



</div>



<br></br>


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**The position of a mobile** on a trajectory is the distance from the origin to the mobile, measured on the trajectory. It is denoted by x.

</div>

<br></br>


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">


**The distance (denoted by d or Δx)** traveled by a mobile is the length of the road traveled by the body from a landmark.



**d = Δx = x<sub>2</sub> – x<sub>1</sub>, dacă x<sub>2</sub> > x<sub>1</sub> (the mobile moves away from the landmark)**


**d = Δx = x<sub>1</sub> – x<sub>2</sub>, dacă x<sub>1</sub> > x<sub>2</sub> (the mobile is approaching the landmark)**


</div>




<br></br>


<div class="alert alert--secondary" role="alert">

&#128294 **Remark**


The distance is always positive, so we subtract the lower position from the higher position.



</div>


<br></br>



<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">


**The duration of the movement (denoted by Δt or t)** represents the time interval in which the mobile traveled a certain distance.


**Δt = t<sub>2</sub> – t<sub>1</sub>**


t<sub>1</sub> = the moment of the beginning of the movement and

t<sub>2</sub> = the moment when the movement ends.

**1. A cyclist starts at kilometer 20 at 12:00 and arrives at kilometer 60 at 13:30. How far did the cyclist travel and how long did the movement last?**


_We write the data of the problem:_   

Initial position: x<sub>1</sub> = 20 km    
Final position:  x<sub>2</sub> = 60 km    
Initial time: t<sub>1</sub> = 12:00    
Final time: t<sub>2</sub> = 13:30

<br></br>
<br></br>


_We apply the distance and duration formula and replace the problem data:_


d = Δx = x<sub>2</sub> – x<sub>1</sub> = 60 km – 20 km = 40 km

Δt = t<sub>2</sub> – t<sub>1</sub> = 13:30 – 12:00 = 1h 30min = 1,5 h

## III.1.3. The average speed.



<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**The average speed (v<sub>m</sub>)** is the physical parameter equal to the ratio between the distance traveled (d) and the duration of the movement (Δt).

<br></br>

**Characterization of the average speed as physical parameter:**

<div class="alert alert--secondary" role="alert">

&#128294 **Remark**

a) **The instantaneous speed** is the speed of the mobile at a certain moment indicated by the speedometer.




<Img className="img-responsive" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul3/3_1_3_Poza3_Vitezometru.jpg" width="1000" height="629" />


For example, a car is traveling at an average speed of 70 km / h. This does not mean that the whole car had this speed. The speedometer may even indicate 140 km / h or 20 km / h.


b) The average speed **is not the arithmetic average** of the momentary velocities of the mobile.

c) Speed has in addition to numerical value **the orientation, ie direction and sense**.

**The direction of the speed** is given by the right on which the mobile is moving.





**The sense of the speed** is represented by an arrow.

<Img className="img-responsive" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul3/3_1_3_Poza4_DirectiaSiSensulVitezei.jpg" width="1000" height="576" />



The girl in the picture is moving at a speed of 1,2 m/s, in a horizontal direction, heading to the right. Indicating the numerical value (1,2), the unit of measurement (m/s), the direction (horizontal) and the sense (to the right), we completely characterized the girl speed.

## III.1.4. Types of movement.

**Types of movement**

**A)	Classification of the movement according to the trajectory:**

- Rectilinear motion, in which the trajectory is a straight line.

- Curvilinear motion, in which the trajectory is a curved line.

- Rotational motion, in which the trajectory is a circle or a circular arc.


**B) Classification of movement by speed:**

- Uniform motion, in which the speed is constant (its value does not change).

- Varied accelerated movement, in which the speed increases.

- Various braking movement, in which the speed decreases.


</div>

<br></br>


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">


**Uniform rectilinear motion** is the motion in which the trajectory is a straight line and the speed is constant.

</div>


<br></br>



<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**In uniform rectilinear motion:**

- The mobile travels equal distances in equal time intervals.

- The current speed is equal to the average speed.

- Speed maintains its numerical value, direction and sense of movement.

<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">


To determine the law of uniform rectilinear motion, we start from the velocity formula, noting with x<sub>0</sub> =  initial position, with x = final position, with t<sub>0</sub> =  initial moment  and with  t = final moment.

a) We notice in the table that Luiza travels equal distances (25 m) in equal time intervals (3 s). So Luiza has a rectilinear and uniform movement. Attention, if the body has a constant speed, the trajectory must be rectilinear. In curvilinear and rotational motion, the speed cannot be constant.


b)

## III.1.5. The graphical representation of the movement.


<div class="alert alert--success" role="alert">

&#128064 **The graphical representation of a mobile movement.**




**In order to represent the graph of the movement of a mobile (Luiza's running on the 100 m track) the following four steps must be completed:**


**1) Make a table with the movement data (their corresponding positions and times).**


<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul3/III-1-5-the-graphical-representation-of-the-movement-picture1-table-with-the-movement-data-of-a-mobile.png" width="1000" height="140" />

<br></br>
<br></br>


**2) Draw the axes, two perpendicular lines, one horizontal and one vertical, on a math sheet or on graph paper. The horizontal axis is called the abscissa axis (Ox) and the vertical axis is called the ordinate axis (Oy). The two axes are graded (calibrated) by choosing a standard for each, so that we can represent all the positions of the mobile and their corresponding moments.**

For our example I will choose as a standard (scale):

For the distance axis:   
1 cm : 5 m 

For the time axis:   
1 cm : 1 s.



- The point of intersection of the axes is O = the origin for each axis, ie at this point we have 0 m and 0 s.

- The abscissa is the axis of time. Note the axis and at its end, write t (s).

- The order is the distance axis (the positions of the mobile are noted on this axis). Note the axis and at its end write x (m).


<br></br>


**3)	Draw each point in the table on the graph.**


- The first point is right at the origin, O (x<sub>0</sub>=0, t<sub>0</sub>=0).

- To represent the second point,  A (x<sub>1</sub> = 25 m, t<sub>1</sub> = 3 s), we proceed as follows: next to the numerical value of 3 s, a vertical line goes, dotted. Next to the numerical value of 25 m, a horizontal line is pointed. The point of intersection of the two dotted lines is the point on the coordinate graph A(x<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>).

- Continue with the other three points:  B (x<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>), C (x<sub>3</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>), D(x<sub>4</sub>, t<sub>4</sub>), according to the model shown above, until all five are plotted points in the table.

<br></br>

**4) Draw the graph of the movement by joining all the previously built points.**

> Don't confuse the trajectory of the mobile with the graph of the movement!

<br></br>

**Using the motion graph we can find more information about how a mobile moves:**   
- The graph of rectilinear and uniform motion is a straight line.    
- If the mobile is at rest, the motion graph is a horizontal line.    
- To draw the graph of the motion it is enough to represent at least two points that together, will determine the right of the graph.    
- The straight line representing the rectilinear and uniform motion is more inclined (forming a larger angle with the horizontal) when the speed is higher.

**2. The graph of the movement of a mobile is represented in the following figure:**

<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul3/3_1_4b_Poza2_GraficulMiscariiProblemaModel.jpg" width="1000" height="654" />


a) What are the positions of the mobile at the moments: t<sub>1</sub> = 0 h, respectively t<sub>2</sub> = 2 h?

b) Is the mobile moving away or closer to the landmark?

c) When does the mobile reach the 120 km position?

d) When does the mobile reach the landmark?

e) What is the speed of the mobile in m / s?



**Solution:**


a)	At t<sub>1</sub> = 0 h, the mobile is in position x<sub>1</sub> = 200 km. From origin, we climb vertically (position axis) until we intersect the graph and thus determine the position x<sub>1</sub> = 200 km.
At t<sub>2</sub> = 2 h, the mobile is in position x<sub>2</sub> = 100 km. We climb vertically (position axis) until we intersect the graph and from the graph we go horizontally dotted, until we intersect the position axis, so we determine the position x<sub>2</sub> = 100 km.


b) The mobile is approaching the landmark (position 0 km), because the positions of the mobile decrease with increasing time.

c) At 120 km, the mobile is 1.5 hours after departure. We start with a dotted line of 120 km horizontally, until we meet the graph and from here, we descend dotted vertically on the time axis.

d) In the landmark, position 0 km, we have a time of 4 h. Originally, we go horizontally (time axis) until we intersect the graph and thus determine the time of 4 h.

e) We write the speed formula:



<Img className="img-responsive4"  src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul3/3_1_4b_Poza3_Ecuatia1ProblemaModel_vers2.jpg" width="1000" height="103" />

When calculating the distance, we subtract x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>, because x<sub>1</sub> > x<sub>2</sub> (the distance is always positive).

When calculating time, we subtract t<sub>2</sub> - t<sub>1</sub>, because t<sub>2</sub> > t<sub>1</sub> (time is positive).

**Solution:**

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7EvS-3eY7Qw" />

<br></br>

a) x<sub>M2</sub> = 30 + 12 ∙ t

x<sub>0M2</sub> = 30 + 12 ∙ 0 = 30 m

x<sub>1M2</sub> = 30 + 12 ∙ 5 = 90 m

x<sub>2M2</sub> = 30 + 12 ∙ 30 = 390 m

x<sub>3M2</sub> = 30 + 12 ∙ 40 = 510 m

## III.1.6. Average acceleration.


<div class="alert alert--secondary" role="alert">

Uniform rectilinear movement is possible in everyday life, only on small sections of the highway. In the case of real movements, the speed of the furniture increases or decreases over time, due to traffic lights, curves, pedestrian crossings, speed limits. All cars have an accelerator pedal and a brake pedal.

**1. Look carefully at the data about the girl's movement. How do we determine the type of movement?**

We notice that in equal time intervals (4 s), the girl travels longer and longer distances. If we calculate the speeds on each portion, they increase. The speeds increase with equal values ​​(Δv = 1 m / s) in equal time intervals (Δt = 4 s). As the acceleration is the ratio between the variation of the speed over time, it follows that the motion is uniformly accelerated rectilinear.
