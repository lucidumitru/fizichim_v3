&#128218 **Summary - Movement and Rest.**




**A body is in a state of motion** when the body changes its position (or distance) from the chosen landmark.



<br></br>



**A body is at rest** when the body does not change its position (or distance) from the chosen landmark.






<br></br>





**The average speed (v<sub>m</sub>)** is the physical parameter equal to the ratio between the distance traveled (d) and the duration of the movement (Δt).




<br></br>



**Characterization of the average speed as physical parameter:**

**In uniform rectilinear motion:**

**- The mobile travels equal distances in equal time intervals.**

**- The current speed is equal to the average speed.**

**- Speed maintains its numerical value, direction and sense of movement.**








<br></br>



**The law of uniform rectilinear motion:**



**x = x<sub>0</sub> + v (t - t<sub>0</sub>) when the mobile moves away from the landmark**

**x = x<sub>0</sub> - v (t - t<sub>0</sub>) when the mobile is approaching the landmark.**


<br></br>
<br></br>




_Using the motion graph we can find more information about how a mobile moves:_

- the graph of rectilinear and uniform motion is a straight line.

- if the mobile is at rest, the motion graph is a horizontal line.

- to draw the graph of the motion it is enough to represent at least two points that together, will determine the right of the graph.

- the straight line representing the rectilinear and uniform motion is more inclined (forming a larger angle with the horizontal) when the speed is higher.





<br></br>
<br></br>






**The average acceleration (a<sub>m</sub> sau a)** is the physical parameter equal to the ratio between the variation of the speed (its increase or decrease) and the duration in which this variation occurred.





<br></br>


**Characterization of average acceleration as physical parameter:**

<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>






**The uniformly varied rectilinear motion**  is the motion of a mobile on a rectilinear trajectory with constant acceleration.


**In uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion:**


- The mobile travels longer and longer distances at equal intervals.

- The momentary acceleration is equal to the average acceleration, being constant.

- Acceleration and speed have the same direction and sense as that of motion.

<br></br>
<br></br>




Remark:
> The best known example of **uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion**  is the free fall of bodies to Earth. **All bodies fall to Earth with a constant acceleration, called gravitational acceleration, g = 9,81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.** **When the body falls free, its initial velocity is v<sub>0</sub> = 0 m/s.**
