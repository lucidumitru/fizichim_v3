**7. The pressure exerted on an area of 1 m<sup>2</sup> is 10 Pa. What is the angle that the direction of the force makes with the normal to the respective surface, knowing that the pressing force is 20 N?**


<br></br>

**8. A steel cylinder of 400 cm<sup>3</sup>, with a density of 7800 kg/m<sup>3</sup> has a diameter of 5 cm. What pressure does it exert on a surface?**

<br></br>


**9. Glycerin with a density of 1260 kg/m<sup>3</sup> is poured into a U tube and then water, with a density of 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> is added. The glycerin column is 15 cm long. How much is the difference between the two liquids in the branches of the tube?**

**11. A 60 g egg with a volume of 60 cm<sup>3</sup> is placed in a brine (salt solution). The sunken volume of the egg is 50 cm<sup>3</sup>. What is the density of brine?**


<br></br>


**12. A wooden cube with a side of 4 cm and a density of 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup> is placed in water, which has a density of 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Find out:**
