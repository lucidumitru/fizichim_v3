&#128064 **Experiment: What is the pressure?**   
&#128293 **Caution** when working with sharp objects! Be careful not to get stung when working with a needle!


<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JrLdPhqzoPw" />




**Required materials:**    
Cutie, o greutate pentru cutie, vas cu făină (pesmet).
Box, a weight to put inside the box, bowl with flour (breadcrumbs).


<br></br>


**Experiment description:**

- Place the empty box with the smallest surface in the flour bowl.
- Notice the trace left by the box in the flour.
- Place the box with the smallest surface with a weight inside it in the flour bowl.
- Notice the trace left by the box with the weight inside it, in the flour.
  > The pressure exerted by the box on a surface is directly proportional to the pressing force of the box on the surface.
- Place the box with the largest surface area and a weight inside it, in the flour bowl.
- Notice the trace left by the box with the weight inside it, in the flour when it has a larger surface than the previous case, with a smaller surface.
  > The pressure exerted by the box on a surface is inversely proportional to the area of the surface on which the pressing force is exerted.

**Pressure (p)** is a physical parameter that measures the ratio between the normal pressing force (F) exerted on a surface and the area of the surface (S) over which the pressing force is distributed.

**Characterization of pressure as physical parameter:**

**Applications**


**a) Pressure is directly proportional to the normal pressing force F<sub>n</sub>**.


**Example:**

The roller that presses the asphalt bitumen with a very heavy cylindrical wheel.

<br></br>
<br></br>



**b) Pressure is inversely proportional to the area of the surface on which the pressing force is exerted.**

**Example:**

- Sharp objects (needles, compass, scissors, knives, etc.) are dangerous (they can cut or sting us) because they have a tip with a very small surface and exert a very high pressures, even at low pressing forces.

<br></br>
<br></br>



- When we are on skis we barely leave marks on the snow compared to the boots, because our weight is distributed on a larger surface and the pressure exerted by us is lower than with the boots.

- When we are on the ice that is cracking, we immediately have to lie on our stomachs and crawl to the shore, because leaving our weight on a larger surface we greatly reduce the pressure we exert on the ice.

<br></br>


- The surface of a stool being flat, our body comes in contact with it on a smaller surface than on the backrest chair, in which case the pressure exerted by the weight of our body is higher. When the surface of the seat is curved, it comes in contact with a larger part of our body and therefore the pressure is lower. So the back seat is more comfortable.

**Pressure has many derivative units:**

**1 bar** = 10 <sup> 5 </sup> Pa

**Physical atmosphere** = **1 atm** = 101.325 Pa

**Technical atmosphere** = ** 1at** = 9,8 ∙ 10 <sup>4</sup> Pa

**Millimeters of mercury column** = **1mmHg** = 1 torr = 133.322 Pa

**Kilogram force per square meter** = **1kgf / m<sup>2</sup>** = 1mm H<sub>2</sub>O = 9,8 Pa

&#128275 **Solved problems**


**1. A 400 g parallelepiped body has the following dimensions:**

L = 0,003 hm

l = 15 cm

h = 100 mm

Find out the three pressures the body exerts on a surface.



**Solution:**


_We write the problem data and turn it into SI._   
m = 400 g = 0,4 kg    
G = m ∙ g = 0,4 kg ∙ 10 N/kg = 4 N    
L = 0,003 hm = 0,3 m    
l = 15 cm = 0,15 m    
h = 100 mm = 0,1 m.

<br></br>


_We apply the pressure formula and replace the problem data:_

**2. A man hits a nail with a force of 600 N in the wall, which makes an angle α = 30° with the wall. The tip of the nail is 2 cm<sup>2</sup>. Find out the human pressure on the wall.**


<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2P4ljrXNaTw" />


<br></br>

**Solution:**

_We write the problem data and turn it into SI._
F = 600 N    
S = 2 cm<sup>2</sup> = 2/10000 m<sup>2</sup>


_Standard:_   
1 cm : 100 N


<br></br>


_We calculate the modulus of normal force on the wall_

F<sub>n</sub> = F ∙ cosα = 600 ∙ 1/2 = 300 N

**Solution:**


_We write the problem data and turn it into SI._
ρ = 2700 kg/m<sub>3</sub>   
h = 20 cm = 0,2 m
