## I.6.1. Decomposition of a vector along two mutually perpendicular directions.



<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">



**The decomposition of a vector along two mutually perpendicular directions** is done as follows:

- From the top of the given vector we go **perpendicular** on the two directions Ox and Oy.
- We write the vectorial equation:

<br></br>
<br></br>



- We write the scalar equation:

&#128294 **Remark**

The decomposition of a vector in two mutually perpendicular directions is the opposite of the composition of two nonlinear and with the same application point vectors, with the parallelogram rule, specifying that the component vectors are in the two main directions: F<sub>x</sub> horizontally and F<sub>y</sub> vertically. Thus we obtain a rectangle whose sides are the segments of the component forces.

&#128275 **Solved problem**


**1.** Laurence strikes a nail with a hammer with a force of 500 N in a wall, holding the nail inclined towards the wall with an angle α = 38°. What is the value of the forces that compose Laurence's force?


**Solution:**


F = 500 N, direction that makes an angle of 38° with the vertical.


We can find out the two forces by the graphical method.

**Standard**:
1 cm : 100 N

500 N : 100 N = 5 cm represents the segment of the force F and we draw it.

From the top of the vector F they go perpendicular to the two directions Ox and Oy.

We measure the segments of the component vectors with the ruler and we multiply with the standard to find out their values.

Fx = 3 ∙ 100 = 300 N    
Fy = 4 ∙ 100 = 400 N

<br></br>
<br></br>



**We check with Pythagoras' theorem**


We write the scalar equation:

<br></br>
<br></br>


500<sup>2</sup> = 300<sup>2</sup> + 400<sup>2</sup>

250.000 = 90.000 + 16.0000
