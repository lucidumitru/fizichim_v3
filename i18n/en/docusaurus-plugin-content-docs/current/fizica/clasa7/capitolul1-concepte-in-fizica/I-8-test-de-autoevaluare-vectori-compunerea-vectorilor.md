&#128221 **Self-assessment test - Vectors. Vector composition.**


**1. Represents a vector d = 20 m, in a horizontal direction, to the left, using as a standard 1 cm : 5 m. -1p**

<br></br>


**2. Represents the force of 600 N with which Johnny strikes with a hammer a nail in the wall, in a direction that makes an angle of 30° with the wall, using as standard 1 cm : 100 N. -1p**


<br></br>

**3. Two forces act on a body. We know: F<sub>1</sub> = 400 N, which acts horizontally, to the left and the resulting force, F = 200 N, in the horizontal direction, to the left. The standard is: 1 cm : 50 N. Graph the force F<sub>2</sub>. -2p**


<br></br>

**4. Compose the following two vectors, which have the same application point: -2p**

F<sub>1</sub> = 180 N, direction that makes an angle of 40° with the vertical, upwards

F<sub>2</sub> = 120 N, vertical direction upwards

Etalon:
1 cm : 30 N

<br></br>



**5. A traveler goes 10 km North, then 60 km West, then 40 km South and finally 80 km East. The standard is:  1 cm : 10 km. Determine the resulting vector. -2p**

<br></br>


**Ex officio: -2p**
