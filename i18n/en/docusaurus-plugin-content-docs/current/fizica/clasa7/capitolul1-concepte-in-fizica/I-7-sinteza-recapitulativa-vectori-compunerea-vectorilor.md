&#128218 **Summary - Vectors. Vector composition.**




**Scalar physical parameter (in short, scalar)** is the physical parameter that is completely characterized by:
- **Numeric value**;
- **Measurement unit**.

The vast majority of physical parameters are scalar: length, area, volume, time, mass, density, temperature, current intensity, electrical voltage etc.







**Vectorial physical parameter (in short, vector)** is the quantity that is completely characterized by:
- **Numeric value (module)**;
- **Measurement Unit**;
- **Orientation**:
  - **Direction**;
  - **Sens**.


**To differentiate a scalar from a vector, an arrow is placed above the symbol of the vectorial physical parameter**.






**Examples of vectorial physical parameters:**

**Graphical representation of a vector..**



**To graph a vector we must draw:**

- A point of application, called the origin of the vector and denoted by 0;
- A line that gives the direction of the vector;
- The segment of the vector that we measure with the ruler using a standard (the value of the vector is divided by the standard chosen to find out the length of the segment);
- An arrow at the end of the segment that will indicate the direction of the vector.

**Addition (composition) of vectors.**


**Adding two (F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>) or more vectors** means determining the resulting vector (F).




**The vectorial equation is**:

**To compose vectors we have two cases:**


I. Composition of collinear vectors (that have the same direction).


**A. If the collinear vectors have the same meaning (the angle between them is 0째)** then the resulting vector has:
- **numerical value** equal to the sum of the numerical values of the component vectors
- **direction** common with component vectors.
- **way** common with component vectors.


**B. If the collinear vectors have opposite meanings (the angle between them is 180째)** then the resulting vector has:
- **numerical value** equal to the difference of the numerical values of the component vectors (subtract from the one with the higher value the one with the lower value)
- **direction** common with component vectors
- **way** of the higher value vector.









**Conventionally, the intersection of the two axes gives rise to four regions, called quadrants, denoted by the Roman numerals I (+, +), II (-, +), III (-, -) and IV (+, -)** .

**II. The composition of nonlinear vectors (which do not have the same direction)** is done according to two rules:



**II.1. For the addition of two nonlinear vectors, which have the same point of application** is used the **Parallelogram rule** by going through the following four steps:


- Draw the two vectors so that they have the same point of application.
- With the segments of the 2 vectors, a parallelogram is formed (quadrilateral with parallel and equal opposite sides).
- Draw the diagonal of the parallelogram that has a common point with the two vectors. This segment represents _the resulting vector_, which is noted and an arrow is placed at the end.
- With the ruler we measure the segment of the resulting vector and with the simple rule of three, we find its numerical value.



**II.2 For the addition of several nonlinear vectors, which do not have the same point of application** is used the **Polygon rule** by going through the following steps:



- Draw the first vector.
- The second vector is drawn with the origin at the top of the first vector, keeping its direction.
- The third vector is drawn with the origin at the top of the second vector, keeping its direction and so on, until we represent all vectors.
- The resulting vector is the segment that is obtained by joining the origin of the first vector (0) with the vertex of the last vector. The resulting vector has the same vertex as the last vector vertex.
- The value of the resulting vector is obtained by measuring its segment with the ruler and then multiplying by the given (chosen) standard.
