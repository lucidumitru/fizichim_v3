## I.1.1. The physical phenomenon.



<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**A physical phenomenon (physical process)** occurs when at least one of the physical properties that characterize a body changes over time.

</div>


<br></br>



<div class="alert alert--secondary" role="alert">

&#128294 **Remark**

Due to a physical phenomenon, the body does not change its substance.

**Physical phenomena classification.**


**1. Mechanical phenomena.**
- related to the **movement** of the bodies (the body changes its position towards a landmark);
- **elongation** of a spring (the spring increases its length) / **compression** of a spring (the spring decreases its length) also called ** elastic deformations **;
- **breaking, cutting** also called **plastic deformations**.

<br></br>

**2. Thermal phenomena**. These are the phenomena related to the change of the thermal state of a body:
- **heating** (the body raises its temperature) / **cooling** (the body lowers its temperature);
- **dilation** (the body increases its volume, by heating) / **contracting** (the body decreases its volume, by cooling);
- **melting** (body changes from solid state to liquid state, by heating) / **solidification** (body changes from liquid state to solid state, by cooling);
- **vaporization** (body changes from liquid to gaseous state by heating) / **condensation** (body changes from gaseous to liquid state by cooling);
- **sublimation** (body changes from solid to gaseous state by heating) / **desublimation** (body changes from gaseous to solid state by cooling).


<br></br>

**3.Electrical phenomena**. There are those phenomena related to:
- **electrification** of bodies (the body is charged with electrical charges);
- **passing** the electric current through a circuit, etc.


<br></br>


**4.Magnetic phenomena**. There are those phenomena related to:
- **the attraction between magnet and ferrous metals** (iron, nickel, cobalt);
- **the attraction and repulsion between two magnets**.

<br></br>

**5.Optical phenomena**. There are those phenomena related to:
- **light reflection** (return of light in the first environment, with change of direction);
- **refraction of light** (passage of light in the second medium with change of direction);
- **rainbow formation etc.**.

<br></br>

**6. Acoustic phenomena.** These are those phenomena related to:
- **propagation** of sound;
- **reflection** of sound.

## I.1.2. The physical parameter.


<div class="alert alert--primary" role="alert">

**Physical parameter** is a physical property that can be measured directly, with a measurement instrument or indirectly, using a calculation formula.
