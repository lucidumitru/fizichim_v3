&#128275 **Experimental problem - The stages of performing an experiment.**

**1.1. How to determine the density of a magnet**




**Needed materials:**    
3 natural magnets of different sizes, scales or scales, water in a graduated cylinder, ruler, graph paper (math sheet).

<br></br>

**Experiment description:**
- Weigh each magnet in turn to determine its mass.
- Measure the volume of each magnet with the graduated cylinder.
- Fill in the data in the following table and process it.

&#128275 **Solved problems - Graphical representation of a vector.**



**1.3. Graph the following vectors:**

**1.3.A.** A traveler travels 10 km on a straight road to the east.

**Solution:**

d = 10 km, horizontal direction, to the right.

Standard:
1 cm : 2 km

To put the point of application we need to see the vector way. This is to the right, we will put 0 to the left of the page.




To find the length of the vector segment we divide the value (modulus) of the vector to the value of the standard: 10 : 2 = 5cm.

We draw a 5 cm segment horizontally and at the top we put the arrow that shows its way. Next to the arrow we note the vector.

<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa7/capitolul1/I-4-graphical-representation-of-a-vector-picture4-solved-problem-graphical-representation-of-a-movement-vector.png" width="1000" height="171" />


<br></br>
<br></br>

<br></br>

**1.3.B.** A body is thrown at a speed of 120 km / h, vertically, downwards.

**Solution:**

So v = 120 km / h, vertical direction, downward way.

Standard:
1 cm : 40 km/h

To put the point of application we need to see the vector way. This being down, we will put 0 at the top of the page.

To find the length of the vector segment we divide the value (modulus) of the vector to the value of the standard:  120 : 40 = 3 cm.

Desenăm un segment de 3 cm pe verticală și în vârf îi punem săgeata care arată sensul lui. Lângă săgeată notăm vectorul.

We draw a 3 cm segment vertically and at the top we put the arrow that shows its way. Next to the arrow we note the vector.

<br></br>

<br></br>



**1.3.C.** A force of 1800 N acts on a body, in a direction that makes an angle of 50 ° with the vertical, upwards.


<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJU5neT0qd8" />


**Solution:**

So F = 1800 N, direction with an angle of 50 ° with the vertical, upward way.

Standard:
1 cm : 300 N

To put the point of application we need to see the vector way. This being up, we will put 0 at the bottom of the page.

To find the length of the vector segment we divide the value (modulus) of the vector to the value of the standard: 1800 : 300 = 6 cm.


Point the main direction, put the line of the protractor on it, with its middle in 0 and measure the angle of 50° with the vertical. In this oblique direction we draw a 6 cm segment and at the top we put the arrow that shows its way. Next to the arrow we note the vector.

<br></br>

<br></br>


**1.3.D.** A body moves accelerated with an acceleration of 42 m/s<sup>2</sup>, in a direction that makes an angle of 30° with the horizontal, upwards.


**Solution:**

So, a = 42 m/s<sup>2</sup>, in a direction that makes an angle of 30° with the horizontal, upwards.

Standard:
1cm : 6 m/s<sup>2</sup>


To put the point of application we need to see the vector way. This being up, we will put 0 at the bottom of the page.

To find the length of the vector segment we divide the value (modulus) of the vector to the value of the standard: 42 : 6 = 7 cm.


Dotted the main direction, put the line of the protractor on it, with its middle in 0 and measure the angle of 30° with the horizontal. In this oblique direction we draw a 7 cm segment and at the top we put the arrow that shows its way. Next to the arrow we note the vector.

&#128275 **Solved problems - Addition (composition) of vectors.**



**1.5.** Two children pull a sledge on a horizontal road, to the west, with the forces F<sub>1</sub> = 400 N, respectively F<sub>2</sub> = 800 N. Compose the two forces of children.



<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aJL8s-z6h0k" />

**Solution:**

**The resulting vector has:**
- **numerical value** equal to the sum of the numerical values of the component vectors, ie F = F<sub>1</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> = 400 N + 800 N = 1200 N.
- **direction** common with component vectors: horizontal.
- **way** common with component vectors: to the left.

To represent the resulting vector we must choose an appropriate standard so that we have enough place for the drawing on the notebook page.

**Standard:**
1 cm: 200 N

The resulting vector segment is 1200 : 200 = 6 cm.



<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa7/capitolul1/I-5-1-composition-of-collinear-vectors-picture2-solved-problem-horizontal-forces-composition-children-sledge-drawing.png" width="1000" height="172" />


<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>




**1.6.** Two forces act on the spring of a dynamometer suspended from a support, one of 60 N, vertically downwards, the other of 150 N, vertically upwards. What force does the dynamometer indicate?


<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YMEn02epM94" />

**Solution:**

**The resulting vector has:**
- **numerical value** equal to the difference of the numerical values of the component vectors, ie F = F<sub>2</sub> - F<sub>1</sub> = 150 N - 60 N = 90 N.
- **direction** common with component vectors: vertical.
- **way** of the higher value vector: up.

To represent the resulting vector we must choose an appropriate standard so that we have enough place for the drawing on the notebook page.

**Standard:**
1 cm: 30 N.

The resulting vector segment is 90:30 = 3 cm.



<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa7/capitolul1/I-5-1-composition-of-collinear-vectors-picture3-solved-problem-vertical-up-forces-composition-drawing.png" width="1000" height="385" />


<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>


**1.7.** Two forces act on a dynamometer, one of 150 N in a vertical direction, upward direction. The dynamometer indicates a force of 90 N, its spring being elongated vertically downwards. Draw the second force acting on the dynamometer spring.


**Solution:**

**Standard:**
1 cm : 60 N.

**We write the vectorial equation:**


<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa7/capitolul1/I-5-addition-or-composition-of-vectors-picture1-vector-equation-two-vectors-composition.png" width="1000" height="64" />

<br></br>
<br></br>



**We write the scalar equation** taking into account the sign convention:

-90 N = 150 N + F<sub>2</sub> (F is taken with minus, because it is vertically down, and F<sub>1</sub> is taken with plus, because it is vertically up)

F<sub>2</sub> = -90 N -150 N = -240 N. It turns out that F<sub>2</sub> has a segment of 240 : 60 = 4 cm, in a vertical direction, the downward way (because it gave us the minus sign).

&#128275 **Solved problem - Composition of nonlinear vectors - Polygon rule.**



**1.9.** A cyclist goes 20 km East, then 40 km South, then 80 km West and 60 km North. Determine the resulting vector, ie how far the cyclist is compared with th initial point of departure (0).

**Solution:**

d<sub>1</sub> = 20 km, horizontal direction, to the right

d<sub>2</sub> = 40 km, vertical direction, down

d<sub>3</sub> = 80 km, horizontal direction, to the left

d<sub>4</sub> = 60 km, vertical direction, upwards

**Standard:**
1 cm : 10 km.


- We represent the first movement vector d<sub>1</sub>. We put the second vector at the top of the first vector, and so on, until we represent all four vectors.

- The resulting vector is the segment obtained by joining the origin (0) with the vertex of the last vector. The resulting vector has the same vertex as the last vector vertex.

- The value of the resulting vector is obtained by measuring its segment with the ruler and then multiplying by the given standard: d = 6,3 ∙ 10 = 63 km. So the cyclist is at a distance of 63 km from the starting point, after the whole race.

**1.10.** Laurence strikes a nail with a hammer with a force of 500 N in a wall, holding the nail inclined towards the wall with an angle α = 38°. What is the value of the forces that compose Laurence's force?


**Solution:**


F = 500 N, direction that makes an angle of 38° with the vertical.


We can find out the two forces by the graphical method.

**Standard**:
1 cm : 100 N

500 N : 100 N = 5 cm represents the segment of the force F and we draw it.

From the top of the vector F they go perpendicular to the two directions Ox and Oy.

We measure the segments of the component vectors with the ruler and we multiply with the standard to find out their values.

Fx = 3 ∙ 100 = 300 N    
Fy = 4 ∙ 100 = 400 N
