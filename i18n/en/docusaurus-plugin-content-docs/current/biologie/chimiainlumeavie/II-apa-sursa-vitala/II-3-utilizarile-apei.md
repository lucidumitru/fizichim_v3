**How to explain hand and laundry washing**


Water alone cannot remove dirt from hands or laundry.
 
Soap (detergent) decreases the cohesive (attracting) force between water molecules and shrinks greasy dirt particles. This is how the soap / detergent removes dirt from the hands / laundry and spreads it in water, away from the washed object.
